; determines if and how the row dendrogram should be reordered. By default, it is TRUE, which implies dendrogram is computed and reordered based on row means. If NULL or FALSE, then no dendrogram is computed and no reordering is done. If a dendrogram, then it is used "as-is", ie without any reordering. If a vector of integers, then dendrogram is computed and reordered based on the order of the vector.
rowv = FALSE
; determines if and how the column dendrogram should be reordered. Has the options as the Rowv argument above and additionally when x is a square matrix, Colv = "Rowv" means that columns should be treated identically to the rows.
colv = FALSE
; function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist.
distMethod = NULL
; default is NULL (which results in "complete" to be used). Can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of "ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average" (= UPGMA), "mcquitty" (= WPGMA), "median" (= WPGMC) or "centroid" (= UPGMC).
hcMethod = NULL
; character indicating if the values should be centered and scaled in either the row direction or the column direction, or none. The default is "none".
